# Day 49 Challenge

In yesterday's challenge, you created a file called high.score and stored some high scores in it.

We've added a version of that file to this repl.

Your program should:

1. Read in the data from the high.score file.
1. Identify which of those users had the highest score. Automatically! (Not you doing it!)
1. Output the name and score of the winner.
