# Day 025 Challenge

Extend Day 24's project and create a health stats generator for a character in a video game.

1. Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
2. Create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice.
3. Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together and return that subroutine as a character's health stats for a video game.
4. Print out the character's health stats.
5. Add a loop to give the user the option to generate health stats for another character.
