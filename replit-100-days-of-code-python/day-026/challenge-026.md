#  Day 026 Challenge

Play a song from this repl and build a menu to go with it. Make it look like an iPod!

+ Use a while true loop to create a title for a music player.
+ Allow the user to select to play a song and use subroutine called 'play' when they select the song.
+ Give the user the option to exit the program.
+ The title should pop up and pause along with the menu options.
+ If the user chooses anything else, start again by clearing the screen.
