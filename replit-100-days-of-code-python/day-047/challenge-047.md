## Note

This want a lot of fun! I always liked these when I was a kid. My mates and I had all sorts of decks:

    + sports cars
    + battle ships
    + tractors
    + tanks
    + airplanes

and so on. 

But I never had a deck with German steam locomotives. 

So I created one for this challenge. Enjoy!
