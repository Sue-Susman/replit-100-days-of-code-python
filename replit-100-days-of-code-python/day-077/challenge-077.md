# Day 077 Challenge

Today's challenge is to set up a simple template for a blog.

Your template should:

1. Have a space for a heading
1. Have a space for today's date
1. Have a space for the text.

+ Now write two different blog entries and serve them on two different endpoints.
+ The blog entries should both use the same template, and have shortened redirects to their URLs
