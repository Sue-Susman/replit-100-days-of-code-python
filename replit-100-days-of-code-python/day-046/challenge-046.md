# Day 046 Challenge

Today, you're going to program a full on Mokébeast Mokédex. Yep, think we're getting away with it so far...

Don't forget, you can reuse your code from Day 42 here.

Your Mokédex should:

1. Store multiple Mokébeasts using a loop.
1. Get user input of the beasts' details.
1. Add the details to a 2D dictionary.
1. Repeat until the user wants to stop.
1. Output the full Mokédex using a prettyPrint() function.
