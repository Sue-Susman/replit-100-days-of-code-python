      <p>I haven't got the foggiest if the kids are still playing this. We did! I had decks with airplanes, sport cars,
        ships, and tanks. I can't remember a deck with German steam locomotives, so i created one here. All technical
        data is correct!</p>
      <p>Cards and their properties are described through nested dictionaries!</p>

      <p>Reading from a CSV file, normalizing file names because a blank in a file name is an abomination, catching
        specific exceptions - this lesson has it all.</p>

      <p>An 'exotic' name was generated from different pieces of personal information. The information was entered on
        one line and then split.</p>

      <p>We still play this classic game with nothing but a well choosen word, a pen, and a sheet of paper.</p>
      <p>Since I omitted the drawing, the code is actually quite simple. To me, it was important to properly denote
        which character was guessed right and where it goes.</p>
