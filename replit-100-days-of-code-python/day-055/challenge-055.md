# Day 055 Challenge

Back the 'f' up everybody!

'f' is short for 'file', of course. What did you think I meant?

Get your minds out of the gutter, go back and get your auto save/load to do list from Day 51 and use it here.

Your program should:

1. Create a backup folder.
1. Create a random filename.
1. Save a copy of the data to that file.
1. This should all happen before the auto save.
