# Day 059 Challenge

You're going to write a program that checks a string to see if it is a palindrome.

Yes. We know that Python has the built in function string.reverse() that you could use.

Zero points for that today, we want you to think hard and utilize your skills in:

+ recursion
+ string slicing
+ looping

Your program should:

1. Prompt the user to input a word.
1. Analyze the word to see if it is a palindrome.
