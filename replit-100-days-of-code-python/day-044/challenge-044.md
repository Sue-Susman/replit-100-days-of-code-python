# Day 044 Challenge
It's time for more bingo! You can reuse your code from day 43, but this time add the following features:

+ Repeatedly ask the user what number comes up next.
+ Check the bingo card to see if the number picked matches one on the card.
+ If the bingo card is all 'X's, then the user has won.
